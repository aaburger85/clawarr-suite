## Publisher:

### License/Terms of Use:

MIT

## Use Case:

External developers and operators use this skill to let an agent inspect, configure, and operate self-hosted media automation stacks across local services, companion containers, request workflows, dashboards, and media tracker sync.

### Deployment Geography for Use:

Global

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: The skill can give an agent operational control over media-stack services through powerful service keys.

Mitigation: Use least-privilege service keys where possible and review agent actions before approving changes to libraries, requests, or service configuration.

Risk: Local browser storage or shared browser origins can expose pasted service secrets.

Mitigation: Avoid pasting secrets into the browser UI on shared origins and prefer environment variables or user-owned configuration files.

Risk: Package installation and companion-service commands can affect the host environment.

Mitigation: Avoid the privileged curl installer unless reviewed, avoid unpinned pip installs unless trusted, and review Docker or SSH environment values before running companion-service commands.

Risk: Network operations target local LAN and user-configured hosts that may expose unsecured media services.

Mitigation: Prefer HTTPS or a trusted management LAN and verify hostnames, ports, and API keys before running setup or management commands.
